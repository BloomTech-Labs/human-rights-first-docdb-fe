## About Human Rights First

Human Rights First is an independent **advocacy** and **action** organization that challenges America to live up to its **ideals**. They believe American leadership is essential in the global struggle for human rights, so they press the U.S. government and private companies to respect human rights and the rule of law. When they fail, they step in to demand reform, accountability and justice. Around the world, they work where they can best harness American influence to secure core freedoms.

<br>

## Our Product

HRF and the [Pat Finucane Centre](https://www.patfinucanecentre.org) need a way to let **researchers view** and **search** historical **documents** related to [The Troubles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles) to **identify potential human rights abuses** and empower victims' families with **evidence** to bring legal cases.

<br>

## Features

- Interprets document files using **Optical Character Recognition** (OCR)
- Clean, simple interface to search & view documents
- Bookmark documents & add tags
- Scrape documents for fields of interest
